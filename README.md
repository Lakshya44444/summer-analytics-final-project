# 🚗 Urban Parking Dynamic Pricing Engine

A data-driven dynamic pricing system for urban parking spaces using real-time data streams.

---

## 📌 Overview

Urban parking spaces are a limited and highly demanded resource. Static pricing throughout the day often leads to inefficiencies such as overcrowding or underutilization.

This project implements an intelligent dynamic pricing engine that updates parking prices in near real-time, reacting to demand patterns, traffic conditions, and vehicle types. The goal is to optimize utilization across 14 monitored parking locations over a 73-day period with 30-minute interval data.
